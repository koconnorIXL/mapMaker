This directory has some files which are helpful for adding the US states
and Canadian provinces as features in our main countries dataset.

In order to accomplish this, simply cd into this directory, and run:

node AddStates.js

This will create a new file in this directory called:

countries_high_res.json

After verifying that the data looks good, copy this file into:

TOP_LEVEL/geojsonDatasets/countries_high_res.json
